=head1 NAME

Path::Canonical - Simple utility to get canonical paths.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Path::Canonical;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Path::Canonical is a simple utility to get canonical paths.
Other tools such as Cwd::abs_path exist, but they need to refer to the actual entry in the file system in order to work.
This is not feasible, for example, when you just want to cleanse the specified path in a web application, where you may
be dealing with a virtual path that does not exist in the file system.
